    Define virtual triangle matricies to hold the similarity values.
    For sorting similarities between pairs, we  only need roughly half the element
    of a full matrix. Using a triangle matrix requires less than half the memory of
    a full matrix, and can protect the programmer from inadvertently accessing one
    of the empty/invalud cells of a full matrix.
